# Rock Paper Scissors Game in JavaScript 🚀🔥

Welcome to my first mini project – the Rock Paper Scissors game! 🎮

## Overview 📝

This project is an exciting dive into JavaScript, covering fundamental concepts that form the backbone of web development. The game allows players to choose between Rock, Paper, and Scissors, competing against the computer, which makes its choice randomly. The project explores essential concepts such as for loops, DOM manipulation, variables, conditionals (if else if), template literals, event listeners, and the use of higher-order functions like Math.random().

## Key Features ✨

- **User Interaction:** Players can select their choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors using interactive buttons.
- **Dynamic Results:** The game dynamically displays the result of each round, showing who wins – you or the computer.
- **Score Tracking:** Keep track of your scores as you compete against the computer in multiple rounds.
- **End Game Option:** Reset the game and scores with a convenient "End Game" button.

- Replit
- Visual Studio Code
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Concepts Explored 🛠️

- **For Loops:** Iterating over elements to simplify code and enhance efficiency.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Interacting with the Document Object Model to update and display content on the webpage.
- **Variables:** Storing and manipulating data to keep track of player choices and scores.
- **Conditionals (if else if):** Implementing logic to determine the winner of each round.
- **Template Literals:** Creating dynamic and formatted strings for better UI presentation.
- **Event Listeners:** Enabling interactivity by responding to user clicks on Rock, Paper, and Scissors buttons.
- **Higher-order Function (Math.random()):** Utilizing Math.random() for generating random computer choices.

## How to Play 🎮

1. Click on the Rock, Paper, or Scissors buttons to make your choice.
2. Witness the computer's randomly generated choice.
3. See the dynamic result and score update after each round.
4. Enjoy the game, and don't forget to use the "End Game" button to reset and start anew!

## Code Structure 🧱

The JavaScript code is organized into functions, providing clarity and modularity. Event listeners handle user clicks, initiating the game logic, and updating the DOM accordingly.

## Conclusion 🌐

Building this Rock Paper Scissors game has been a fantastic learning experience. It not only solidified my understanding of core JavaScript concepts but also introduced me to the excitement of creating interactive and dynamic web applications.
